## Details

This app is a very basic example of integration between Lightstreamer and Flutter, showing the opening and closing of a client session with the server
and the subscription of a couple of Items of the demo StockList to get the real-time data.

1. Depend on it. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file located inside the app folder, and add `lightstreamer_flutter_client: ` under dependencies.

        dependencies:
            flutter:
                sdk: flutter

            # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
            # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
            cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
            # The following adds the Lightstreamer plugin to your application.
            lightstreamer_flutter_client: ^1.0.0
        ```
