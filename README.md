## Details

This app is a very basic example of integration between Lightstreamer and Flutter, showing the opening and closing of a client session with the server
and the subscription of a couple of Items of the demo StockList to get the real-time data.

### Import the package

To add the Lightstreamer plugin to your Flutter application:

1. Depend on it. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file located inside the app folder, and add `lightstreamer_flutter_client: ` under dependencies.

        dependencies:
            flutter:
                sdk: flutter

            # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
            # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
            cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
            # The following adds the Lightstreamer plugin to your application.
            lightstreamer_flutter_client: ^1.1.0

2. Install it. From the terminal: run `flutter pub get`.\
From Android Studio/IntelliJ: Click `Packages get` in the action ribbon at the top of `pubspec.yaml`.\
From VS Code: Click `Get Packages` located in right side of the action ribbon at the top of `pubspec.yaml`.

3. Import it. Add a corresponding import statement in the Dart code.

        import 'package:lightstreamer_flutter_client/lightstreamer_flutter_client.dart';
